# Promise_Based_Email_Validation
This Node.js program checks whether a user-provided email address already exists in a text file (Email_data.txt). If the email is not present, it adds the email to the file. If it already exists, it rejects the request with an appropriate message.
This simulates a basic email registration system, similar to the signup process where duplicate email registrations are not allowed.
